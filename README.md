In this project I have displayed all the skills that I have been studying with Flexbox so far, CSS, HTML and putting it all in one big project.
<br>
<br>
I have used the various skills such as:
<br>
<br>
1: Creating Flexbox containers with display: flex and putting them inside divs, section headings to format the layout of the website.
<br>
<br>
2:Using various classes to format the layout to the design specifications.
<br>
<br>
3: Learning how to use the figcaption and figure HTML elements
<br>
<br>
4: Learning how to use align content, justify content within the flex containers to display the webpage as I want to and knowing that I need to create indvidual containers within containers if I need to align a part inside an already flex container.
<br>
<br>
5: Using Paddings and Margins when I need to create space between elements
<br>
<br>
6: Using the nth:child pseudo class for the first time and seeing the benefits of it.
<br>
<br>
What I struggled with:
<br>
<br>
I struggled with at first aligning the items with how I wanted it to go. I got stuck on the navbar and the header sections for a long time because of this. For the navbar, I just needed to apply padding and margins to it. For the heading, I struggled with getting the image to the right of the text that I needed it to be where when I went back to it, deleted some code and did it all as a row it allowed me to place it where I wanted it to. I wanted to add some margins/paddings to it to get it in a better place but it was altering the whole header content which I didn't manage to find out how to solve it but it was fine as it was (adding an actual image there made it better)

What I Liked About The Project:
<br>
<br>
I really liked being let loose by myself. For the longest time I was always stuck in tutorial hell where I wasn't really learning anything just following along but being let loose by myself to learn Flexbox was hard but fun. I know feel like I got a good solid understanding of Flexbox.
